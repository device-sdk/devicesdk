# @devicesdk/cli

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 71aedb1: **Manual migration required:** in every `devicesdk.ts`, rename the `entrypoint:` field to `className:`. There is no alias — `devicesdk build/dev/deploy/flash` will fail fast with a rename hint until the file is updated. Also rename `pin_state` → `pin_state_update` if you have firmware older than this release flashed to a device.

  Consolidated DX refactor — closes a half-dozen first-day pit-of-failure traps in the scaffold/build/flash flow:
  - **@devicesdk/cli (BREAKING)**: rename the device config field `entrypoint` → `className`. The old field name was misleading (it sounds like a file path; it was actually a class name). No alias — projects that still reference `entrypoint` get a clear migration error from config parse. The scaffold (`devicesdk init`) now writes `main`, `className`, `deviceType`, and `wifi` placeholders together, producing a config that validates out of the box. Wifi placeholders (`YOUR_WIFI_SSID`, `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD`) are rejected at config parse so you can't accidentally deploy with the scaffold defaults.
  - **@devicesdk/cli**: scaffold templates now use named exports (`export class Device extends DeviceEntrypoint`). The Worker bundler imports user classes by name; a `export default class` produced a confusing "No matching export" error at deploy time. `devicesdk build` now validates the user file's exports up front and surfaces a tailored fix-up hint when the named export is missing.
  - **@devicesdk/cli**: scaffold `tsconfig.json` no longer sets `rootDir: "./src"` — that conflicted with `include: ["devicesdk.ts"]` (a root-level file) and broke `tsc --noEmit` on a fresh project.
  - **@devicesdk/cli + @devicesdk/api**: `devicesdk flash` now surfaces a tailored error when the API has no firmware artifact published for a Zod-accepted device_type. The API returns `code: "FIRMWARE_NOT_PUBLISHED"`; the CLI prints "Firmware for X is not yet published" with a build-from-source pointer instead of a bare 404.
  - **@devicesdk/core**: `PinStateUpdate` is now a discriminated union by `payload.mode` — digital reads carry `value: "high" | "low"`, analog reads carry `value: number`. Aligns the typed contract with what firmware actually emits. Firmware (Pico + ESP32) now emits the `pin_state_update` discriminator that types and consumers (DO broadcaster, dashboard) already expected; the previous `pin_state` mismatch silently dropped state events.
  - **@devicesdk/core**: ship `SSD1306.esp32c3OledVariant()` static factory — the 72×40 0.42″ panel always needs `columnOffset: 28`. Replaces the magic-number copy/paste in the docs.
  - **@devicesdk/website**: ESP32-C3 docs use the new `SSD1306.esp32c3OledVariant()` preset and note that the prebuilt `esp32c3-client.bin` may not be promoted yet (build from source in the meantime).
  - **@devicesdk/dashboard**: dashboard temperature template narrows on `payload.mode === 'analog'` to type-check against the new `PinStateUpdate` union.

### Patch Changes

- 394d469: UX fixes batched from a new-user trial — eight small papercuts, one PR:
  - **@devicesdk/cli**: `loadConfig` / `getConfigDir` now walk up parent directories to find `devicesdk.ts`, so `deploy`, `dev`, `flash`, `logs`, `status`, `inspect`, and `env` work from any subdirectory of a project. `--config` and `DEVICESDK_CONFIG` still short-circuit the walk.
  - **@devicesdk/cli**: `devicesdk logs` accepts optional positionals — both default from `devicesdk.ts`. With one positional it's treated as the device slug (project comes from config); with two, it's `[project] [device]` as before. Multi-device projects without a positional get a friendly "pass one as positional" error listing the available device slugs.
  - **@devicesdk/cli**: 4xx response bodies are no longer dumped to stderr on every API error. Auth-revoked sessions now print one line — `Session expired — run \`devicesdk login\`.`— instead of`Response body (401): { ... }`followed by paragraph-long advice. Run with`--verbose`to keep the raw dump for debugging. The`downloadDeviceFirmware`path picks up the same treatment, so`flash` is quieter on auth/server errors.
  - **@devicesdk/cli**: `flash` permission-denied error mentions the Arch Linux `uucp` group (not just Debian's `dialout`) and links to the docs page that ships a persistent `99-devicesdk-serial.rules` snippet.
  - **@devicesdk/api**: the device runtime no longer prepends `[<projectId>:<deviceId>]` to every `console.log/info/warn/error/debug` call. Persisted log entries were already prefix-free; this drops the redundant tag from Wrangler tail / runtime stdout. Devices already carry their identity via the watcher URL.
  - **@devicesdk/simulation**: when the local dev server restarts after a file edit, the simulator UI now auto-reconnects with exponential backoff (1 s → 30 s) and shows a "Local server restarted — reconnecting…" banner instead of silently going dead until the user refreshes the browser.
  - **@devicesdk/website**: new `concepts/identifiers` page explains project slug vs device slug vs the underlying UUIDs in one place. The CLI reference index now points at it. The `flash` page documents serial-port permissions for both Debian-style (`dialout`) and Arch (`uucp`) systems, ships a copy-pasteable `99-devicesdk-serial.rules` udev snippet for CP210x / CH340 / FTDI bridges, and adds a "Verify connectivity" subsection pointing at `devicesdk status` after the LED sequence. The pin-read example on the first-device page is now a complete copy-pasteable snippet showing how to discriminate digital vs analog reads.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- c19ce77: Logs-quota runaway fix + layered rate-limit defense:
  - **@devicesdk/api (breaking)**: deprecate `GET /v1/projects/:projectId/devices/:deviceId/logs` — the endpoint now returns `410 Gone` with `Link: …/watch>; rel="alternate"` and `code: "LOGS_DEPRECATED"`. The corresponding DO RPC `BaseDevice.getLogs` throws on call. A stale CLI `--tail` polling loop in May 2026 burned the daily Durable Object rows-read free-tier quota in ~5 hours each day; the polling pattern is now structurally impossible.
  - **@devicesdk/api**: watcher WebSocket (`/watch`) gains `?backfillLimit=N&backfillLevel=warn` query parameters. On connect the server emits up to N replay frames (`{ event: "log", data, replay: true }`, oldest-first) followed by a single `{ event: "history_complete" }` marker, then live broadcasts as before. One SQL scan per connection instead of per HTTP poll.
  - **@devicesdk/api**: add `TieredCache` (`caches.default` L1 → KV L2 with back-fill) and a single `CACHE` KV namespace. Two consumers: `userBlockListMiddleware` (mounted post-auth — 429s blocked users at the edge of the worker without touching D1 or the DO) and `authCache.ts` (caches `authenticateUser` lookups for 60 s, dropping ~95% of D1 reads per request on active tokens). Logout / onboarding completion / account-deletion request all invalidate the entry.
  - **@devicesdk/api**: when the per-user rate limit fires, also write a 1-hour cross-route block to `CACHE` so subsequent requests 429 immediately. Per-user rate limit is now scoped to `/logs` only (other routes are protected by tier limits inside their handlers and the WAF rule below).
  - **@devicesdk/cli (breaking)**: `devicesdk logs` and `devicesdk logs --tail` now use the watcher WebSocket exclusively. Both modes accept `--lines` and `--level`; the polling loop is gone. `--tail` reconnects with exponential backoff (1 s → 30 s) and bails with a non-zero exit code after 5 consecutive failures.
  - **@devicesdk/dashboard**: device logs panel migrates to WS-only. `useDeviceStream` accepts `{ backfillLimit, backfillLevel }` and exposes a `historyLoaded` ref; the panel shows a "Loading recent logs…" spinner until `history_complete` fires. The "Live" toggle and "Load More" button are removed — backfill + live are one stream.
  - **@devicesdk/website**: documents the manual Cloudflare WAF rate-limit rule under `docs/internal/operations/cloudflare-waf.md` and the new auth-cache / block-list architecture in CLAUDE.md.

  **Manual deploy steps** (also in the PR description):
  1. KV namespace IDs are already in `apps/api/wrangler.jsonc` (created in this branch).
  2. Apply the WAF rule per `docs/internal/operations/cloudflare-waf.md`.

  - @devicesdk/core@1.2.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e53d79f: Add ESP32-C3 as a supported device type.
  - Firmware: new `sdkconfig.defaults.esp32c3` (WS2812 on GPIO 8); `Kconfig.projbuild` defaults addressable LED on for the C3 target; `hal.c` branches on `SOC_RMT_SUPPORTED` and uses the RMT backend for led_strip on C3 (C61 keeps the SPI backend).
  - Build & CI: `firmware/esp32/package.json` `build:all` + `publish` now emit and upload `esp32c3-client.bin`. The `firmware-esp32` GitHub workflow is converted to a target matrix (`esp32`, `esp32c61`, `esp32c3`) with per-target R2 uploads on main.
  - API: `POST /v1/projects/:p/devices/:d/firmware` accepts `device_type: "esp32c3"`. The ESP branch now uses `startsWith("esp32")` to route any ESP variant to `<target>-client.bin`.
  - CLI: `DeviceType` gains `"esp32c3"`; `isEsp32DeviceType` simplified to `startsWith("esp32")`; `getEsp32ChipName` returns `"esp32c3"` for the new target, and `devicesdk flash` routes C3 devices to `flashESP32` with `--chip esp32c3`. Tests cover the new device type in `config.test.ts` and `flash.test.ts`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [e53d79f]
  - @devicesdk/core@1.2.0

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 23b8924: - Fix `devicesdk init` template: declare `@devicesdk/core` as a runtime dep of the CLI so resolved versions reflect the installed package (was hardcoded `^0.0.1`); install with the package manager that invoked the CLI (pnpm, yarn, npm, or bun) via `npm_config_user_agent` detection.
  - Expose `./package.json` in `@devicesdk/core` package exports so version lookups via `createRequire` / `require.resolve` work under Node's `exports`-enforced resolution.
  - Return a 500 JSON error when UF2 firmware validation fails after patching, instead of a 200 response with an `X-Firmware-Validation: failed` header that most clients would ignore.
  - Add a safety comment in the device Durable Object explaining the in-memory `logWatchers` cleanup behavior across hibernation.
- 7900434: - Extract duplicate project+device lookup into `foundation/projectDeviceResolve.ts`, used by `getDevice`, `updateDevice`, `deleteDevice`, `sendCommand`, and `watchDevice`.
  - Centralize dashboard API host in `config/apiHost.ts` with a `VITE_API_HOST` env override; four call sites now read from one source.
  - Add `DEVICESDK_SIMULATOR_ASSETS_PATH` env override for `devicesdk dev` when the packaged simulator assets are unavailable.
  - Introduce canonical CLI exit code constants (`packages/cli/src/exitCodes.ts`) and document them in `docs/cli/_index.md`. All 48 `process.exit()` call sites now use named constants.
  - Remove order-dependent 403-retry pattern in `limits.test.ts` by resetting the free user's projects in `beforeEach`.
  - Deduplicate firmware base64 primitives into a shared header-only `firmware/common/base64_core.h` used by both the ESP32 (C) and Pico (C++) implementations.
  - Delete the orphaned `firmware/pico/lib/lwip_ws/ws_client.c` stub (the real implementation lives in `ws_client.cpp`).
- b84d2cc: - Add usage examples (`.addHelpText("after", ...)`) to every `devicesdk` subcommand — `login`, `logout`, `whoami`, `init`, `dev`, `build`, `deploy`, `logs`, `flash`, `status`, `inspect`, `env set`/`list`/`unset`. Discoverable via `--help`.
  - Import `HaEntityDeclaration` type from `@devicesdk/core` in `config.ts` instead of redeclaring it. The local Zod schema stays in the CLI (core has no runtime deps), but its inferred shape is now type-asserted against the core interface to catch drift.
  - Remove `"dependsOn": ["^build"]` from the `lint` Turbo task — linting does not need built upstream artifacts, so this lets `pnpm lint` run in parallel with (and independently of) `pnpm build`.
- 916fcd1: - Fix `devicesdk dev` crashing on startup with `ReferenceError: DurableObject is not defined`. The simulator's `deviceBridge.ts` had only a type-only `declare class DurableObject` and no runtime import, so workerd couldn't find the class and the user's script never loaded. Now imports `DurableObject` from `cloudflare:workers`.

  - @devicesdk/core@1.1.2

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 618636f: Add error handling for DO RPC calls, R2 operations, and script validation; fix npm package metadata and README
- 6ba99ed: Security and quality improvements for public launch: 401 session handling, logout error handling, UF2 validation surfacing, redirect URL validation consolidation, security headers, privacy policy, terms of service, CLI version fix, and core README update.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c9a38e3: Add cron-style scheduling for device scripts via `crons` property and `onCron()` lifecycle method.

  Device scripts can now declare named cron schedules using standard 5-field cron expressions. The runtime automatically manages DO alarms to fire `onCron(name)` at the scheduled times.

  ```typescript
  class MyDevice extends DeviceEntrypoint {
    crons = {
      heartbeat: "*/5 * * * *", // every 5 minutes
      dailyReport: "0 8 * * *", // every day at 08:00 UTC
    };

    async onCron(name: string) {
      if (name === "heartbeat") {
        const reading = await this.env.DEVICE.i2cRead(0, "0x76", 6);
        console.info("Sensor:", reading);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- 5d8f9da: Add offset-based pagination to ListProjects, ListDevices, and ListApiTokens endpoints. Response format changes from a flat array to `{ items: [...], page: number, per_page: number, has_more: boolean }`. Both the dashboard and CLI auto-paginate to fetch all pages transparently.
- 8c397df: Add `devicesdk status` command that shows live connection state, script version, and last-seen time for all devices in a project. Queries the Durable Object WebSocket state directly for real-time connection status.
- 9ab6698: Add hardware peripheral support: SPI, UART, watchdog timer, on-die temperature sensor, I2C batch write (ESP32), and PIO WS2812 addressable LEDs (Pico). Includes full-stack implementation across firmware, core types, device sender, API, CLI inspect REPL, and simulator.
- 00991a8: Add Home Assistant integration support across the stack:
  - **Generic watch WebSocket** (`GET /v1/projects/:projectId/devices/:deviceId/watch`) delivers real-time `status`, `log`, and structured `state` events over a single hibernation-friendly connection. Replaces the legacy SSE log stream as the canonical real-time primitive. The dashboard now uses this endpoint.
  - **`emitState(entityId, value)` SDK method** on `DeviceSenderInterface` lets device scripts publish structured telemetry to watchers (custom sensors, I2C readings, derived values).
  - **Auto-emitted state events** for built-in hardware messages: `gpio_state_changed`, `pin_state_update`, and `temperature_result` are broadcast as structured `state` events without requiring `emitState` calls.
  - **`HaEntityDeclaration` types** in `@devicesdk/core` for declaring Home Assistant entities.
  - **`ha.entities` config key** in `devicesdk.ts` — the CLI's `deploy` command uploads these declarations to the new `GET/PUT /entities` endpoints after a successful script push.

- 59cb75a: Add `devicesdk inspect <device-id>` interactive hardware inspection CLI command. Opens a REPL for exploring device hardware (GPIO read/write, ADC, PWM, I2C scan/configure/read/write, input monitoring, reboot) without writing a device script. Backed by a new `POST /v1/projects/:projectId/devices/:deviceId/command` API endpoint.
- 1c28cba: Add project-scoped environment variables for device scripts.

  Device scripts can now access secrets via `this.env.VARS.get("KEY")` without hardcoding them in source code. Variables are managed per-project with CLI commands (`devicesdk env set KEY=VALUE`, `env list`, `env unset KEY`) and stored securely outside of device scripts.

### Patch Changes

- 0006ef0: Add `devicesdk logs <project-id> <device-id>` command for viewing and streaming device logs. Supports `--tail`/`-f` for real-time tailing with cursor-based polling, `--level` for severity filtering, and `--lines` to control the initial batch size.
- 5012c53: Add unit tests for the credentials module covering loadCredentials, saveCredentials, deleteCredentials, getToken (including token refresh and expiry), and requireAuth
- 77935f2: Add unit tests for the deploy command covering single-device upload, batch upload, project auto-creation, dry run, message option, and error handling paths.
- 3998ff1: Add test coverage for esp32c61 device type in config validation and flash command
- 14d569d: Add unit tests for generateDeviceTypes in the build command
- 06fb0a4: Add unit tests for the init command
- 0380536: Add unit tests for the login command
- efcf060: Add unit tests for the getConfigDir utility function
- d13518c: Add unit tests for the whoami and logout commands

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- bdd52f7: Add inter-device communication (RPC): devices within the same project can call public methods on each other via `this.env.DEVICES["slug"].method()` with full TypeScript autocomplete, return types, and graceful offline handling.

  ### `@devicesdk/core`
  - New type `RemoteDevice<T>` — extracts public non-lifecycle methods from a device class
  - New type `GetEnv<ProjectDevices>` — generates the full `Env` type with `DEVICE` and `DEVICES` bindings
  - `DeviceEntrypoint` now accepts an `Env` type parameter for type-safe inter-device access

  ### `@devicesdk/api`
  - New `DevicesBridge` WorkerEntrypoint routes RPC calls between Durable Objects
  - `BaseDevice.handleRemoteCall()` loads user scripts and dispatches method calls
  - `classProxy` generates nested JS Proxy for `this.env.DEVICES` and exposes `callMethod` with lifecycle method blocking
  - Max call depth of 3 prevents infinite cycles (A → B → A)

  ### `@devicesdk/cli`
  - `devicesdk build` now generates `devicesdk-env.d.ts` alongside `devicesdk.ts` with `ProjectDevices` type map and `Env` helper

  ### Examples

  ```typescript
  // src/devices/sensor.ts — call a method on another device
  import { DeviceEntrypoint, type DeviceResponse } from "@devicesdk/core";
  import type { Env } from "../../devicesdk-env";

  export class Sensor extends DeviceEntrypoint<Env> {
    async onMessage(msg: DeviceResponse) {
      if (msg.type === "gpio_state_changed" && msg.payload.pin === 20) {
        // Type-safe! Autocomplete shows turnOn, turnOff, updateDesiredState
        const result = await this.env.DEVICES["light-controller"].turnOn();
        console.info("Light turned:", result.status);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```typescript
  // src/devices/light.ts — expose methods for other devices to call
  import { DeviceEntrypoint, type DeviceResponse } from "@devicesdk/core";
  import type { Env } from "../../devicesdk-env";

  export class LightController extends DeviceEntrypoint<Env> {
    async turnOn() {
      await this.env.DEVICE.setGpioState(5, "high");
      return { status: "on" as const };
    }

    async turnOff() {
      await this.env.DEVICE.setGpioState(5, "low");
      return { status: "off" as const };
    }

    // KV writes work even when hardware is offline
    async updateDesiredState(state: { brightness: number }) {
      await this.env.DEVICE.kv.put("desired", state);
    }

    async onDeviceConnect() {
      const desired = await this.env.DEVICE.kv.get<{ brightness: number }>(
        "desired",
      );
      if (desired) {
        console.info("Applying saved brightness:", desired.brightness);
      }
    }

    async onMessage(msg: DeviceResponse) {}
  }
  ```

  ```typescript
  // devicesdk.ts — no changes needed, just define your devices
  import { defineConfig } from "@devicesdk/cli";

  export default defineConfig({
    projectId: "smart-home",
    devices: {
      "light-controller": {
        main: "./src/devices/light.ts",
        entrypoint: "LightController",
        deviceType: "pico-w",
        wifi: { ssid: "...", password: "..." },
      },
      sensor: {
        main: "./src/devices/sensor.ts",
        entrypoint: "Sensor",
        deviceType: "pico-w",
        wifi: { ssid: "...", password: "..." },
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  Run `devicesdk build` to generate `devicesdk-env.d.ts` with the `Env` type, then import it in your device files.

### Patch Changes

- bc3493a: Add device logging pipeline: console.log/info/warn/error/debug in user device scripts are automatically captured, persisted to per-device storage, served via GET /v1/.../logs endpoint, and displayed in dashboard Logs tab.

  Breaking: removed `LoggerInterface` and `LOGGER` from `UserWorkerEnv` in `@devicesdk/core`. Use `console.log`/`console.info`/etc. instead of `this.env.LOGGER.info()` — logging is now handled transparently via console override.

- bfa6d9c: Fix stale config test that expected a file path to be valid for the `entrypoint` field after the class-name regex was added
