Add `devicesdk inspect <device-id>` interactive hardware inspection CLI command. Opens a REPL for exploring device hardware (GPIO read/write, ADC, PWM, I2C scan/configure/read/write, input monitoring, reboot) without writing a device script. Backed by a new `POST /v1/projects/:projectId/devices/:deviceId/command` API endpoint.
