## Overview

DeviceSDK runs on a globally distributed runtime to provide low latency and scale for IoT applications.

## Component Overview

### Device Firmware

The firmware runs on your microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico W) and handles:
- WebSocket connection to edge
- Hardware abstraction (GPIO, ADC, I2C, etc.)
- Message serialization
- Automatic reconnection
- Credential management

### WebSocket Gateway

A persistent connection between device and runtime:
- TLS encrypted
- Binary message protocol
- Low latency (~50-200ms)
- Automatic keepalive
- Connection pooling

### Device Entrypoint

Your TypeScript code running on a serverless runtime:
- Handles device messages
- Sends commands to devices
- Connects to your chosen external services
- Fast cold starts and globally distributed

## Data Flow

### Device → Cloud

1. Device sends message over WebSocket
2. Gateway routes to your script
3. `onMessage()` is called
4. Your code processes message
5. Can trigger external APIs, store data, etc.

### Cloud → Device

1. Your code calls `env.DEVICE.send()`
2. Message queued for delivery
3. Sent over WebSocket to device
4. Device processes command
5. May respond with result

## Message Protocol

Messages are JSON-based:

```json
{
  "type": "gpio_write",
  "pin": 25,
  "value": 1
}
```

Standard message types are defined, but you can create custom types for your application.

## Script Execution Model

Your device entrypoints run as:
- **Stateless functions** - No long-running processes
- **Event-driven** - Triggered by device events
- **Isolated** - Each request in separate context
- **Fast** - Typical execution < 10ms

## Persistent Storage

For state management:
- **KV Storage** - Per-device key-value storage
- **Logs** - Structured logging
- **Webhooks / APIs** - Call your own services for external persistence

## Security Model

- **Device credentials** - Unique per device, embedded in firmware
- **TLS encryption** - All communication encrypted
- **Token authentication** - API access controlled by tokens
- **Isolation** - Scripts run in isolated contexts

## Deployment Model

When you deploy:
1. Code compiled to JavaScript
2. Uploaded to DeviceSDK
3. New version created (immutable)
4. Globally distributed in seconds
5. Devices reconnect to new version

## Scaling

DeviceSDK scales automatically:
- **Devices** - Millions supported
- **Messages** - No practical limit
- **Geography** - Global by default
- **Load** - Automatic distribution

No infrastructure management required.
