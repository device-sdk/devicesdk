# @devicesdk/api

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- bc3493a: Add device logging pipeline: console.log/info/warn/error/debug in user device scripts are automatically captured, persisted to per-device storage, served via GET /v1/.../logs endpoint, and displayed in dashboard Logs tab.

  Breaking: removed `LoggerInterface` and `LOGGER` from `UserWorkerEnv` in `@devicesdk/core`. Use `console.log`/`console.info`/etc. instead of `this.env.LOGGER.info()` — logging is now handled transparently via console override.

- bdd52f7: Add inter-device communication (RPC): devices within the same project can call public methods on each other via `this.env.DEVICES["slug"].method()` with full TypeScript autocomplete, return types, and graceful offline handling.

  ### `@devicesdk/core`
  - New type `RemoteDevice<T>` — extracts public non-lifecycle methods from a device class
  - New type `GetEnv<ProjectDevices>` — generates the full `Env` type with `DEVICE` and `DEVICES` bindings
  - `DeviceEntrypoint` now accepts an `Env` type parameter for type-safe inter-device access

  ### `@devicesdk/api`
  - New `DevicesBridge` WorkerEntrypoint routes RPC calls between Durable Objects
  - `BaseDevice.handleRemoteCall()` loads user scripts and dispatches method calls
  - `classProxy` generates nested JS Proxy for `this.env.DEVICES` and exposes `callMethod` with lifecycle method blocking
  - Max call depth of 3 prevents infinite cycles (A → B → A)

  ### `@devicesdk/cli`
  - `devicesdk build` now generates `devicesdk-env.d.ts` alongside `devicesdk.ts` with `ProjectDevices` type map and `Env` helper

  ### Examples

  ```typescript
  // src/devices/sensor.ts — call a method on another device
  import { DeviceEntrypoint, type DeviceResponse } from "@devicesdk/core";
  import type { Env } from "../../devicesdk-env";

  export class Sensor extends DeviceEntrypoint<Env> {
    async onMessage(msg: DeviceResponse) {
      if (msg.type === "gpio_state_changed" && msg.payload.pin === 20) {
        // Type-safe! Autocomplete shows turnOn, turnOff, updateDesiredState
        const result = await this.env.DEVICES["light-controller"].turnOn();
        console.info("Light turned:", result.status);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```typescript
  // src/devices/light.ts — expose methods for other devices to call
  import { DeviceEntrypoint, type DeviceResponse } from "@devicesdk/core";
  import type { Env } from "../../devicesdk-env";

  export class LightController extends DeviceEntrypoint<Env> {
    async turnOn() {
      await this.env.DEVICE.setGpioState(5, "high");
      return { status: "on" as const };
    }

    async turnOff() {
      await this.env.DEVICE.setGpioState(5, "low");
      return { status: "off" as const };
    }

    // KV writes work even when hardware is offline
    async updateDesiredState(state: { brightness: number }) {
      await this.env.DEVICE.kv.put("desired", state);
    }

    async onDeviceConnect() {
      const desired = await this.env.DEVICE.kv.get<{ brightness: number }>(
        "desired",
      );
      if (desired) {
        console.info("Applying saved brightness:", desired.brightness);
      }
    }

    async onMessage(msg: DeviceResponse) {}
  }
  ```

  ```typescript
  // devicesdk.ts — no changes needed, just define your devices
  import { defineConfig } from "@devicesdk/cli";

  export default defineConfig({
    projectId: "smart-home",
    devices: {
      "light-controller": {
        main: "./src/devices/light.ts",
        entrypoint: "LightController",
        deviceType: "pico-w",
        wifi: { ssid: "...", password: "..." },
      },
      sensor: {
        main: "./src/devices/sensor.ts",
        entrypoint: "Sensor",
        deviceType: "pico-w",
        wifi: { ssid: "...", password: "..." },
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  Run `devicesdk build` to generate `devicesdk-env.d.ts` with the `Env` type, then import it in your device files.

### Patch Changes

- 211a1d8: Add missing test coverage for devices endpoint: 404 cases for PUT (non-existent device and project), 404 for GET list with non-existent project, and 401 unauthorized tests for POST, GET list, PUT, and DELETE endpoints
- 93bedec: Fix DELETE /v1/projects/:projectId returning `project_id` instead of `project_slug` in response body
- 3940fd0: Fix DELETE /v1/tokens/:tokenId returning 200 for non-existent tokens instead of 404
- 395c433: Fix R2 path mismatch in script upload endpoints that caused GET /script and GET /versions/:versionId to always return 404

  Both `uploadScript` and `batchUpload` were writing script files to R2 using internal UUID-based paths (`{userId}/{project.id}/{device.id}/...`), while `getScript`, `getVersion`, and `deployVersion` read using slug-based URL params (`{userId}/{projectSlug}/{deviceSlug}/...`). This meant the reading endpoints could never locate uploaded scripts. Additionally, neither upload endpoint wrote a `latest.js` file, which `getScript` requires.

- 07ed6ed: Remove unused `ApiException` imports from 16 API endpoint files
- Updated dependencies [bc3493a]
- Updated dependencies [bdd52f7]
  - @devicesdk/core@1.0.0
